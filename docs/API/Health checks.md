# Health checks
To check if the service is running and serving use the `grpc_health_probe` tool. Documentation on
this tool can be found [here](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe/). Documentation
on interaction with the health checks in a Kubernetes context can be found
[here](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/10/01/health-checking-grpc-servers-on-kubernetes/).
