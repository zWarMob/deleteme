# Terminology
Terminology specific to the Encryptonize service is introduced when needed. Every term will be
marked in **bold**. Value types are called by their protobuf name. For an overview of these names
translated to supported languages see this
[list](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#scalar).

# Encryptonize configs
By default the Encryption Service reads its configuration from the TOML file `config.toml`. This
behaviour can be modified by setting the environment variable `ECTNZ_CONFIGFILE`. The supported file
formats are TOML, YAML, and JSON.

All configuration options are documented in the example configuration
[`encryption-service/scripts/dev-config.toml`](../../encryption-service/scripts/dev-config.toml). 
All configuration options can be overwritten by a corresponding environment variable. For example, 
the URL for the object storage can be overwritten by setting `ECTNZ_OBJECTSTORAGE_URL`.

The configuration is divided in 4 sections. Each section is briefly described below.

## Keys configs
Keys are used by Encryptonize to secure confidentiality and integrity of the data. Therefore make sure 
that these are generated securely and randomly. The data cannot be accessed without the keys, so make 
sure to have a proper backup. 

## Auth storage configs
Auth storage contains user authorization data. Auth storage can be any database which supports Postgresql.
Encryptonize needs the host, port and credentials of the database in order to establish connections. 

## Feature flags configs
These flags can be used to toggle different features of Encryptonize.

## Object storage configs
Object storage contains all the encrypted data. Anything that supports the [S3 protocol](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html) 
can be used as object storage. Encryptonize needs to be configured with the URL, credentials and 
certificate for the object storage.

# Authentication
All authentication on the Encryptonize service is done via an `authorization` pair in gRPC metadata. 
It should contain the user access token and be in the form `bearer <user access token>`. 
A correct authentication metadata query could look like this:
```
{
  "authorization": "bearer AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",
}
```
This token is obtained upon user login as described in the [User Login section](#user-login). 
Note that the access token is short lived (1 hour).

# Users and Groups
A **user** is an authentication entity in the encryption server, and is only represented by a user
ID. The user ID is used to identify a single user. Each user has a password which can be used to
obtain an access token for authentication and authorization.

A **group** is an authorization entity on the encryption server, and is only represented by a group
ID. The group ID is used to identify one or more users who are members of the group. A user is
automatically a member of a group with the same group ID as the user's user ID. A group has a set of
**scopes** which determine what endpoints its users are authorized to access. A user has to be a
member of at least one group with the required scope to access an endpoint. For a description of the
scopes, see the [API documentation](../API/Authorization).

An **object** is a cryptographically signed package containing the stored ciphertext and the
associated data. A user can share stored data with other users/groups by modifying the permissions
on an object. Instructions on how to share data between users/groups can be found in the section on
[*Permissions*](#permissions). The user that creates an object automatically has permission to
acccess that object, and any user/group that can access an object can modify the permissions.

It should be noted that while the access tokens and passwords should be kept secret, user IDs can be
considered public information and safely shared between parties.

All IDs are of the format version 4 UUID ([RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) section 4.4).

## Managing Users
### Bootstrapping users
To bootstrap the Encryptonize service with an initial user, once the service has been started,
execute `./encryption-service create-user <scopes>`.  Here, `<scopes>` is a string describing the
scopes the user's group should have. Each scope is mapped to a character as described in the table
below. The scopes are described in further detail in the [API documentation](../API/Authorization).
E.g., to create a user with `READ` and `CREATE` scopes, call `./encryption-service create-user rc`.

| Scope               | Character |
| ---                 | ---       |
| `READ`              | `r`       |
| `CREATE`            | `c`       |
| `UPDATE`            | `u`       |
| `DELETE`            | `d`       |
| `INDEX`             | `i`       |
| `OBJECTPERMISSIONS` | `o`       |
| `USERMANAGEMENT`    | `m`       |

Note that users are only valid for other Encryption Services that use the same key material.
Information on bootstrapping in Docker and Kubernetes environments is provided in the following
sections.

#### Docker example
If using docker run:
```
docker exec <CONTAINER ID> ./encryption-service create-user <scopes>
```

#### Kubernetes example
If using kubernetes with kubectl run:
```
kubectl -n encryptonize exec deployment/encryptonize -- /encryption-service create-user <scopes>
```
For more info on user management in Kubernetes, see the [Encryptonize Kubernetes README](../../kubernetes/README.md).

### Creating users through the API
To create a user through the API, you need to call the `authn.Encryptonize.CreateUser` endpoint. The
request should contain an attribute named `scopes` which enumerates all the scopes the user's
initial group should have. Users can only be created by a user with the `USERMANAGEMENT` scope.

Once a user has been created, a new `user_id` and `password` will be returned from the call. Note
that a group with the requested scopes and an ID equal to the `user_id` is automatically created.

### User login
When a user is created, you get the User ID and the password. You can use this information to obtain
the short-lived access token, which is necessary for authentication towards the API. You can login
by calling the `authn.Encryptonize.LoginUser` endpoint. Provide the User ID and the password in your
request object.

### Remove user
To remove a user, you need to call the `authn.Encryptonize.RemoveUser` endpoint. This endpoint
requires the `USERMANAGEMENT` scope. The request must contain the `user_id` of the user to be
removed. If the request was successful, you will receive an empty response.

## Managing Groups

### Creating groups
To create a group through the API, you need to call the `authn.Encryptonize.CreateGroup` endpoint.
The request should contain an attribute named `scopes` which enumerates all the scopes the user's
initial group should have. Groups can only be created by a user with the `USERMANAGEMENT` scope.
Once a group has been created, a new `group_id` will be returned from the call.

### Adding and removing users
In order to modify the members of a group, you need to call the `authn.Encryptonize.AddUserToGroup`
and `authn.Encryptonize.RemoveUserFromGroup` endpoints. In both cases the request should contain the
`group_id` of the group in question and the `user_id` of the user to be added/removed.

# Storage
You can let Encryptonize store your encrypted data through the `storage.Encryptonize` API. In the
following, we provide a short description of the exposed endpoints.

## Storing data
To store data through the API, you need to call the `storage.Encryptonize.Store` endpoint. To access
this endpoint the user must have the `CREATE` scope. The request should contain two attributes named
`plaintext` and `associated_data`.

The `plaintext` is the data to be encrypted and stored. The `associated_data` is metadata attached
to the plaintext. The `associated_data` will not be encrypted, but it will be cryptographically
bound to the ciphertext, ensuring integrity and authenticity. The `associated_data` can be used for
indexing or other purposes.

The `object_id` will be returned from the operation. This value should be kept safe as it will be
used to retrieve the object again from the service.

## Retrieving data
To retrieve data through the API, you need to call the `storage.Encryptonize.Retrieve` endpoint. To
access this endpoint the user must have the `READ` scope. The operations takes the `object_id` of
the object to be retrieved. If the operation is successful, the object is returned in decrypted
format along with any associated data.

## Updating data
To update an existing object, you need to call the `storage.EncryptonizeUpdate` endpoint. To access
this endpoint, the user must have the `UPDATE` scope. The request must contain the updated
`plaintext`, the updated `associated_data` and the `object_id` of the object that needs to be
updated. On a succesful request, the response will be empty. Note that concurrent updates/deletes of
the same objects might lead to race conditions and is not safe.

## Deleting data
To delete an existing object, you need to call the `storage.Encryptonize.Delete` endpoint. To access
this endopoint, the user must have the `DELETE` scope. The request must contain the `object_id` of
the object which should be deleted. Note that concurrent updates/deletes of the same objects might
lead to race conditions and is not safe.

# Storage-less encryption
The Encryptonize API allows to bypass the storage and instead return the encrypted packages back to
the user. This might be useful if you wish to manage the encrypted data yourself.

## Encryption
You can encrypt an object and get the encrypted package back using the `enc.Encryptonize.Encrypt
endpoint`. The caller needs the `CREATE` scope in order to use this endpoint. Similar to the `Store`
endpoint, you need to provide the `plaintext` and the `associated_data`. The response of this call
will contain the `ciphertext`, the `associated_data` and the `object_id`. Note that the
`associated_data` is not encrypted.

## Decryption
To decrypt an object, you need to call the `enc.Encryptonize.Decrypt` endpoint and provide the
`ciphertext`, `associated_data` and the `object_id` in the request. This endpoint requires the
`READ` scope. If you are authenticated towards the API and authorized to read the object, the
response will contain the `plaintext` and the `associated_data`.

# Permissions
Access to an object is shared through the concept of object permissions.

Every object has a list associated with it with the group IDs of the groups who are able to access
and modify the object. In order to modify the permission list, the user must be in a group that has
access to the object (i.e. is in the permission list of the object).

## Get permissions of an object
To get the permission list of an object, you need to call the `authz.Encryptonize.GetPermissions`
endpoint. To access this endpoint the `INDEX` scope is required. The operation will return a list of
`group_id`s that have access to the object.

## Add permissions to an object
To add a group to the permission list of an object, you need to call the
`authz.Encryptonize.AddPermission` endpoint. To access this endpoint the `OBJECTPERMISSIONS` scope
is required.

## Remove permissions from an object
To remove a group's permission from an object, you need to call the
`authz.Encryptonize.RemovePermission` endpoint. To access this endpoint the `OBJECTPERMISSIONS`
scope is required.

# Version
To get version information about the running encryption service, you need to call the
`app.Encryptonize.Version` endpoint. Currently, the endpoint returns the git commit hash and an
optional git tag. This endpoint does not need any scopes but requires the user to be authenticated
by presenting a valid access token.
